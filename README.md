# 🛒 Integrated Retail Analytics for Store Optimization This project demonstrates an **end-to-end data science workflow** applied to retail data. The goal is to analyze store performance, detect anomalies, segment stores, and build predictive models to support **data-driven retail optimization**. --- ## 📌 Problem Statement Retail businesses generate massive amounts of transactional and operational data across different stores and departments. However, without effective analytics, it becomes difficult to: - Detect unusual sales behavior (anomalies) - Identify similar groups of stores (segmentation) - Forecast sales using predictive modeling - Support decision-making for promotions, stocking, and resource allocation This project aims to solve these challenges through **integrated analytics and machine learning**. --- ## 🎯 Objectives - Perform **data cleaning, preprocessing, and feature engineering** - Conduct **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** for insights into sales patterns - Detect **anomalies** in sales trends - Segment stores using **clustering techniques** - Build and evaluate a **Random Forest regression model** for sales forecasting - Visualize results through intuitive plots --- ## 📂 Project Structure Retail-Analytics-Store-Optimization/ │── Dataset/ # Raw datasets (sales, features, stores) │── plots/ # Visualization outputs │── detected_anomalies.csv # Anomaly detection results │── store_segments.csv # Store segmentation results │── feature_cols.json # Feature engineering details │── Integrated_Retail_Analytics_for_Store_Optimization.ipynb # Main notebook │── requirements.txt # Python dependencies │── .gitignore # Ignored files (large/system files) --- ## 🛠️ Tech Stack - **Python**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn - **Machine Learning**: Random Forest Regression, Clustering (KMeans) - **Tools**: Jupyter Notebook, Git, GitHub --- ## 📊 Key Features - **Data Preprocessing** – handled missing values, transformations, and scaling - **EDA & Visualization** – weekly trends, holiday effects, store types, correlations - **Anomaly Detection** – identified abnormal sales patterns - **Segmentation** – grouped stores based on key performance metrics - **Predictive Modeling** – trained and evaluated Random Forest model for sales --- ## 🚀 How to Run 1.
